## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
I'm Batuhan, an MSc computer engineering student at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) and a full-time research engineer at [Aselsan Inc.](https://www.aselsan.com/en) in Ankara, TÃ¼rkiye. I received my electrical and electronics engineering BSc degree from [Middle East Technical University (METU)](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) with high honors in 2022, in Ankara, TÃ¼rkiye. 

I have worked on various topics throughout my undergraduate education: computer architecture, image signal processing, and computer vision, under the supervision of [Prof. A. Aydin Alatan](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/tr/personel/aydin-alatan). Currently, I am focusing on my MSc thesis about inverting 3D generative models under the supervision of [Asst. Prof. Aysegul Dundar](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~adundar/).

My current research mainly revolves around computer vision with deep learning: deep generative networks and inverse problems in image restoration.
