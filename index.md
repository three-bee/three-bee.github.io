I got my CS MSc at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) in 2025, and EEE BSc at [Middle East Technical University (METU)](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) in 2022.

My MSc thesis focused on 3D reconstruction from single images with generative models, under the supervision of [Asst. Prof. Aysegul Dundar](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~adundar/). My current interests cover 3D/4D reconstuction and controllable video generation models.
